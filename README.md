## SWOT Analysis 


Strengths: 
Currently i have solid understanding of the functionality of my code and how to implement in in (JS code functionality) and what i want my workout-app to look like.

Weakness: 
Not very good understanding of grid-template areas/ not too familiar with airtable data bases.


Opportunity:
I can finally build a very cool fitness App which is something i always wanted to do using react!!!

Threats:
I need to do research on grid-template areas since that is the format i want to use so youtube here i come!
